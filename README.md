Sup! My name is Frenzy, kinda. Anyway, I'm your regular college boi who's always procrastinating and writing shit code.

I tend to forget the things I make so sometimes I end projects halved and prob some time later I could finish it, or not, idk.

I know some Python, Java HTML/CSS/JS, and from time to time I do a bit of bash (still googling basic syntax crap)

Rant over my code, steal it, fork it, blow it up, idk. Feedback and Destructive opinion are always welcome. 

Linux is my passion, even if its one to suffer when ricing

Currently using Manjaro aka autistic arch with i3 aka the virgin wm on Nord theme aka the Normie theme

If I can remember (or not procrastinate or something) I'll attach here my website thingy, my resume, and some other stuff I have around idk. Anyway hire me i need a job lul
