# Hi! My name is ✨ Frenzy ✨. 

📓 Just your regular college boi who's always procrastinating and writing shit code.

🙃 I tend to forget the things I make so sometimes I end projects halved other times are done a year later, or simply never

I know some 🐍 Python, ♨️ Java 🌐 HTML/CSS/JS, and from time to time I do a bit of 🚀 bash (still googling basic syntax crap)

👯 Rant over my code, steal it, fork it, blow it up, idk. Feedback and Destructive opinion are always welcome.

🌱 Currently learning more bash and C++ and some workflow practices (gonna crash)

👾 Linux is my passion, even if its one to suffer when ricing

💻 Currently using Manjaro aka autistic arch with i3 aka the virgin wm on Nord theme aka the Normie theme

⚙️ I have some projects, kinda, small trinkets I make for fun.
